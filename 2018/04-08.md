# Early April

## Guidebook
Some very generous friends are lending their talents to create a brand package and guidebook. This will include things like downloadable signage, how to promote, etiquette, etc. Tammi Heneveld and North Bryan are in Slack: hit them up (or reply to this email) if you've noticed a need or have a tip that should be shared.

## Online Community
The idea to host a central, public online community (e.g. Slack, Spectrum.chat, Discourse) was floated this week in the Slack. The nays had it, however, and the idea was tabled/shelved/put on ice for the time being.

## Shoutouts
* Denver - **Brian**, pulled mad numbers for a solo event he hosted (he shared some tips in #general; bonus: this is rad)
* Portland - **Will**, giving a lightening talk in a lightening moment
* NYC - **Joe's Pizza**, eight words were said between three people in the most efficient pizza transaction in the world

## Stats
15 cities, 6 countries, 53 events

*P.S. I applied for a WeWork Creators Award which could provide funding help. Please send good vibes to the San Francisco judges.*
