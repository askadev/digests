# Late April 2018

## Survey
Congrats all on reaching the three month mark. What a ride. To make sure we're still on the rails, I put together a survey for **mentors only** that covers communication, organization, chapter members, and direction (link removed from Github edition). Please take it if you have the time; all results will be submitted to a friend outside the org, so really, don't pull any punches. This survey will be open for two weeks. *Aside: extra credit if you put together a mentee survey for your own city or for all of them; hit me back to blast it out.*

## WeWork as a Host
If you're outgrowing your space or need a space in the first place, you can [apply to host at WeWork](https://www.meetup.com/requestspace/). WeWork has worked well in Portland. (h/t Mike, Melbourne)

## Shoutouts
* NYC - **Robert and Jackson**, partnering with a [code school for lower income populations](https://www.accesslabs.org/) (and giving a talk talk there). They're also neat guys in person.
* DC - Dojo Code School - generously hosted [a talk](https://github.com/askadev/talks/tree/master/talks/2018-04-12-the-tupperware-problem) two weeks ago and promoted our event in the city

Stay cool,

Tim
