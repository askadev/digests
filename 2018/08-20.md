Hey all,

Not much from a central org point, but it's been a minute and I wanted to give some extra love to a few mentors.

**London**

Ed's been doing some really solid social media work. Every [event](https://twitter.com/TotallyMoney/status/1004762843860828161) [has](https://twitter.com/TotallyMoney/status/1019890262653456384) [been](https://twitter.com/TotallyMoney/status/1004711345470701568) [pushed](https://twitter.com/TotallyMoney/status/1004656475422232576) on social media - the host has even [taken the piss](https://twitter.com/TotallyMoney/status/1002493468390895616) admirably.

**Denver**

Whitney has been giving out stickers like there's no tomorrow and always follows-up before they run out. Holler if you're out of swag.

**Melbourne**

Mike guesses July 4 saw their biggest meetup and August had a sweet-spot 2:1 mentee/mentor ratio.

**Portland**

Nichole stuck around _for an hour_ after regular hours to help a mentee. Above and beyond.

**Austin**

Morgan scaled up for the summer with two-a-week, and now they're scaling back but making sure [to consider the community first](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnygSKzQyvyJeh5Omjc4ZAEfqVLPT_s69LRGV2eRSpZM9tbg/viewform) (this was blasted to their Meetup group).

**Otherwise**

I don't hear too frequently from KC or Berlin, but you're still updating events and plugging away regularly. Cheers.
