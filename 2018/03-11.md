# Early March 2018

Hey all,

While Slack is a fine tool, it's not the right one for organizing events that meet once a month. Instead, I'm going to try a biweekly email update for reasons best resigned to a postscript (although Slack will remain available for you to use). The pertinent topics:

## Local Talks
This week I gave a [short talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX5VYDxvYi8) at a local code school ([https://github.com/askadev/talks/tree/master/talks/2018-03-09-programming-for-people](content) is [CC0](https://github.com/askadev/talks/blob/master/UNLICENSE); slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Jrjv2ujlV-40RJtawayWMjVUWxaIhEOoUOKufqymAdo/edit?usp=sharing)). The director told his students Ask a Dev was a good opportunity to network, to get extra curricular help, to be mentors themselves: universal truths for any chapter.

I *strongly, strongly* encourage you to reach out to event organizers/code schools in your city and do the same on behalf of your chapter. Improve my flawed version. Make your own ([even submit](https://github.com/askadev/talks#adding-a-new-talk) it to the community). Use this [form email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_kbUwz-nIvDdsn3XQM8RRRScaFv8qGJscZBf--iioo/edit?usp=sharing). You're talented folk; you've got wisdom to share.

## Planning and Self-promotion
Talks are great promotion for your Ask a Dev chapter. Otherwise, please [make sure to promote](https://github.com/askadev/community-standards#promotion) for your city, add it to [the site](https://askadev.org/), and [notify newsletters and event sites](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aaTWKOzhWl64znQ8dCzLocott5uMEt9pJYiXA1bzP0c/edit?usp=sharing). Do this as soon as you know your next event date (Portland mentors discuss logistics of the next event immediately after our latest one while we're in person).

## Updated [Community Standards](https://github.com/askadev/community-standards)
Added a Code of Conduct, an attendance policy, and a promotion checklist.


And, as always, thank you for volunteering your time and attention to these things. In one month, Ask a Dev has seen 26 events in 12 cities and 5 countries. You're doing good in the world.

Best,
Tim

## Slack
Some cities have active online members, but the majority don't: messages are left unreplied for days or eternity. Email notifies more successful and consistently. Chapters with only one mentor have little use for Slack. From an org<->chapter standpoint, you don't need to hear from central that often as chapters become more autonomous. The Slack group will remain live: it's great for initially coordinating a bunch mentors in one city especially if you're strangers, some chapters really frequent it, and it's nice for the success stories / chapter-to-chapter tips. I'll always be available on there.
