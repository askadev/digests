## Guide
In an effort to make the [community standards](https://github.com/askadev/community-standards) more digestible, I organized it in [linear fashion with better tips](https://askadev.org/guide). Please throw up a [PR](https://github.com/askadev/askadev.org/pulls) if you've got tips or see some any holes.

## Red cup, blue cup
Dan of Austin noted they've been using a system similar to the [pylons mentioned in the last digest](https://github.com/askadev/digests/blob/master/2018/05-20.md) but with a grocery store staple. He says: "You can get like 20 red and 20 blue solo cups, where each attendee can put the red on top when they need help and the blue on top when they are cruising."

## Shoutouts
* Denver - **Brian & Whitney** - Keeping the successes rolling with their last meetup, even getting some interview help in
* Austin - **Morgan, et. al.** - Not satisfied with one-a-week, they've moved to two, seeing more more low-level questions on Friday and more high-level questions on Sunday.

## 100 Meetups
We're about to hit triple digits. Very well done, everyone.
