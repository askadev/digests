## Guide
In an effort to make the [community standards](https://github.com/askadev/community-standards) more digestible, I organized it in linear fashion with better tips. Please throw up a PR if you've got tips or see some any holes.

## Red cup, blue cup
Dan of Austin noted they've been using a system similar to the [pylons mentioned in the last digest](https://github.com/askadev/digests/2018/05-20.md): red and blue Solo cups.

## Shoutouts
* Denver - **Brian & Whitney** - Keeping the successes rolling with their last meetup, even getting some interview help in
* Austin - **Morgan, et. al.** - Not satisfied with one-a-week, they've moved to two, seeing more more low-level questions on Friday and more high-level questions on Sunday.

## 100
We're about to hit triple digits. Very well done, everyone.
